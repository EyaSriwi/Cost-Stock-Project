A multilingual web portal was developed to unify dashboards and predictive models into a single, accessible platform. This portal facilitates:  
- Seamless user navigation between views.  
- Centralized access to all performance indicators and insights.  
- Language support for both **French** and **German** users.  

The project encompassed end-to-end processes, including **data integration**, **cleansing**, and **transformation** using advanced tools. It delivers a robust solution for improving cost management and operational transparency.
